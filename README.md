## Features

### 1. Intelligent Statement Merging & Aggregation

The application uses a sophisticated merging algorithm that:
- Identifies overlapping date ranges using a B-tree data structure
- Deduplicates transactions based on unique reference numbers (chqRefNumber)
- Maintains running balances with automatic validation
- Supports continuous statement uploads with automatic reconciliation

### 2. Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms

#### B-tree for Date Range Management
- Uses a B-tree to efficiently store and query date ranges
- O(log n) complexity for finding overlapping statements
- Optimizes memory usage for large datasets

#### Transaction Deduplication
- Hash-based transaction identification
- O(1) lookup time using Map data structures
- Consistent handling of duplicate entries across multiple statements

#### Batch Processing with Sliding Window
- Implements sliding window algorithm for transaction tags
- Processes large datasets in configurable batch sizes
- Prevents memory overload while maintaining performance

### 3. Global Tagging System

- Shared tag repository across users
- Efficient transaction-tag relationship management
- Real-time tag updates with optimistic UI

### 4. Performance Optimizations

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Processes tags in batches of 100 transactions
   - Implements request throttling to prevent API overload
   - Uses Map data structure for O(1) lookups

2. **Caching**
   - In-memory caching of tag data
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - State management with React Context

3. **Database Design**
   - Efficient indexing on chqRefNumber
   - Normalized schema for tags and transactions
   - Optimized queries for large datasets

## DSA Concepts in Action

### Example 1: Statement Merging with B-tree
```typescript
class DateRangeNode {
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  left?: DateRangeNode;
  right?: DateRangeNode;
  
  // O(log n) insertion
  insert(node: DateRangeNode) {
    if (node.startDate < this.startDate) {
      if (!this.left) this.left = node;
      else this.left.insert(node);
    } else {
      if (!this.right) this.right = node;
      else this.right.insert(node);
    }
  }
  
  // O(log n) overlap check
  findOverlaps(range: DateRange): DateRangeNode[] {
    const overlaps: DateRangeNode[] = [];
    if (this.overlaps(range)) overlaps.push(this);
    if (range.start < this.startDate && this.left) {
      overlaps.push(...this.left.findOverlaps(range));
    }
    if (range.end > this.startDate && this.right) {
      overlaps.push(...this.right.findOverlaps(range));
    }
    return overlaps;
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Batch Processing with Sliding Window
```typescript
async function processTags(transactions: Transaction[]) {
  const BATCH_SIZE = 100;
  const WINDOW_DELAY = 200; // ms

  for (let i = 0; i < transactions.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
    const batch = transactions.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
    await processTransactionBatch(batch);
    
    // Sliding window delay to prevent API overload
    if (i + BATCH_SIZE < transactions.length) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, WINDOW_DELAY));
    }
  }
}
```

## Comparison with Traditional Methods
